# jKeyboard
This repository contains the files for creating my custom keyboard:
- The `wasd_file` folder contains all the Adobe Illustrator files for making my [WASD keyboard](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/).
- The `karabiner` folder contains all the files for my [Karabiner-Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) settings.

The keyboard looks like this:
