# jKeyboard
This repository contains the files for creating my custom keyboard:
- The `wasd_file` folder contains all the Adobe Illustrator files for making my [WASD keyboard](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/).
- The `karabiner` folder contains all the files for my [Karabiner-Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) settings.

# The Keyboard
The keyboard looks like this:
![alt text](https://raw.github.com/jhelvy/jKeyboard/master/wasd_files/keyboard_preview.jpg "Keyboard Layout")

The most significant thing about this design is the blue "hyper" key that is in place of the "capslock" key. When held down, this key changes the functionality of many other keys. The keys that are changed have little blue icons in the lower-right corners that describe what the "hyper" functionality is.
